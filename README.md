# Quiz App

This is a simple web-based quiz application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches quiz data from an API, presents questions to the user, tracks their score, and includes a timer.  The app also features a start screen and a "Game Over" state.

## Project Overview

The application fetches quiz questions from a specified API endpoint (e.g., Open Trivia Database).  It then dynamically displays these questions and their multiple-choice options to the user. Users can select an option, and the app provides immediate feedback on whether the answer is correct.  A timer adds a time limit to each question. The user's score is displayed and updated throughout the quiz.  The app transitions through questions until all questions are answered or the timer runs out, at which point a "Game Over" message is displayed.

## Features

*   **API Integration:** Fetches quiz questions from an external API.
*   **Dynamic Question Display:**  Presents questions and options fetched from the API.
*   **Multiple Choice Options:**  Allows users to select one answer from multiple choices.
*   **Immediate Feedback:**  Shows whether the selected answer is correct or incorrect.
*   **Score Tracking:**  Keeps track of the user's score.
*   **Timer:**  Implements a timer for each question.
*   **Start Screen:**  A welcome screen to start the quiz.
*   **Game Over State:**  Displays a "Game Over" message when the quiz ends.
*   **Attractive UI:** Uses CSS for an engaging user interface with smooth transitions and animations.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository (Optional):** If you have this project in a repository (e.g., GitHub), you can clone it to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2.  **Download the Files:** If you don't have a repository, simply download the `index.html` file (and any associated CSS or JavaScript files if you separate them) and save it to your computer.

3.  **Open in Browser:** Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.).

4.  **API Endpoint:** The code uses the Open Trivia Database API as an example: `https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&type=multiple`.  If you want to use a different API, you'll need to:

    *   Find the API endpoint for the quiz data you want to use.
    *   Modify the `apiUrl` variable in the JavaScript code to point to your new API endpoint.
    *   Adjust the way the code accesses the questions and answers from the API response (the code currently assumes a structure similar to the Open Trivia Database API).  You might need to change `data.results` to match your API's response structure.

## How to Use

1.  **Start Quiz:** Click the "Start Quiz" button on the welcome screen.
2.  **Answer Questions:** Select the answer you think is correct for each question.
3.  **Next Question:** Click the "Next" button to proceed to the next question. The "Next" button is only enabled after you select an answer.
4.  **Timer:** Pay attention to the timer! If it reaches zero, the game is over.
5.  **Game Over:** The quiz ends when you have answered all the questions or the timer runs out. Your final score will be displayed.

## Further Development

This quiz app can be further enhanced with features like:

*   **Difficulty Levels:** Allow users to select a difficulty level.
*   **Question Categories:** Let users choose a category of questions.
*   **More Gamification:** Add sound effects, animations, or a leaderboard.
*   **Improved UI/UX:**  Further refine the user interface and experience.
*   **Local Storage:** Save the user's score using local storage.
*   **Backend Integration:** Store quiz data and user scores in a database.
